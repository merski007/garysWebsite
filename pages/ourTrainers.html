            <h2>Jeremy Brown, ACE Certified Personal Trainer, CPR/AED Certified</h2>
            <p>I became a Personal Trainer to further explore a passion of mine, but also to help others look and feel great. From years of my own consistency, I had many asking me what I do and how I do it, and I felt compelled to share my experiences and knowledge with as many as I can. I have been training at Innovative Health and Fitness in Franklin, Wisconsin for just over a year now and have met and trained many individuals of all ages and capabilities. I am grateful for the experience I’ve obtained as a trainer there and am excited to take on some new challenges. I started my fitness journey out while watching the Insanity DVD’s about 8 years ago in the comfort of my own home and have since expanded on that. It is that experience that has equipped me well to an at home training regimen, of which I have helped various individuals out with as well. I exercise to stay healthy, stay fit, and perform at a high level. I enjoy playing various sports of various intensities, so I train myself in a way that allows me to stay safe from injuries and also perform at my best. With experience training with other certified professionals, I have a strong emphasis on functional fitness and foundational elements. Ensuring proper use of muscles to avoid straining them. Previous past life of mine was a bartender for about 9 years and many years in sales and retail along with an associated degree in Interior Design from Milwaukee Area Technical College. I feel the experiences I’ve gained in my past has helped me become a versatile Personal Trainer with the utmost professionalism and conversational personality. I believe one of my strong suits is listening, and I intend on keeping that at the forefront. By listening to your goals and your past, only further helps me help you get you to where you want to be!</p>
